# FLANN-image-matching
Feature extraction and matching of multiple images using FLANN algorithm
There is an existing image library that contains many images with different content. Given a given image, the FLANN algorithm is used to extract features from the given image, and the most similar image is found in the image library. Connect the feature points corresponding to the given image and the most similar image with lines one by one, and mark the position of the object in the most similar image with a rectangular box
